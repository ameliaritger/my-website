<br />
I am a proud member of the <a href="http://www.hofmannlab.com/" target="_blank">Hofmann Lab</a> working on my PhD in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology at UC Santa Barbara. Prior to joining the graduate program at UCSB, I worked as a research assistant with the 
<a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/research/2280-kronauer-laboratory/" target="_blank">Kronauer Lab</a> at Rockefeller University and as an independent scientist at the <a href="http://www.researchstationcarmabi.org/" target="_blank">Caribbean Marine Biological Institute</a>
in Cura√ßao. I received my BA from Dartmouth College, where I was able to explore my love for Ecology and realize a new interest in Anthropology.

While I have explored a variety of questions in an array of systems, my current research uses the strawberry anemone (*Corynactis californica*) and the black turban snail (*Tegula funebralis*) to better understand large-scale patterns of intraspecific variation, phenotypic plasticity, and local adaptation. I am an experimental ecologist at heart, happiest when I am exploring out in the field and making new discoveries in the lab.
