This project explored how intraspecific variation might play a role in the ability of the strawberry anemone (Corynactis californica) to act as a deterrent to urchin foraging.

Purple urchins, starved for a minimum of 7 days, were placed in aquaria containing kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) protected by a barrier of strawberry anemones. 3 color morphs of strawberry anemones were used (Red, Pink, and Orange) in trials to assess any differences in the ability of genets (genetically identical individuals) to deter urchins from grazing on kelp. Kelp consumption by urchins was measured using photos taken of kelp blades before and after experimental trials, which lasted between 19:00 and 7:00 (30 minutes before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively) in late August-early September. Urchin behavior was tracked using photos (taken by GoPro Hero3+) of the experimental set up each minute for approximately 5 hours at the start of each experiment. Urchin behavior was compared between genets to examine how intraspecific variation might play a role in the associational refuge offered by the strawberry anemone to macroalgae in temperate kelp forests.

The following code works through data organization and analysis of urchin foraging behavior ( minus video analysis), analysis using logistic regression treating binary kelp consumption (yes/no) as a Bernoulli distribution and mixed model ANOVA treating tile as a random effect in kelp consumption by urchins

### Load packages, load data, tidy data

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
library(here)

## LOAD DATA
data <- read.csv("raw.csv")

## TIDY DATA
# my own OCD, fix "Trial" issue
colnames(data)[colnames(data)=="Ã¯..Trial.number"] <- "Trial"

# Clean names for R
data <- data %>%
  clean_names()

# To remove instances where we have video evidence of urchins not moving (and not eating kelp)
data <- data[(data$urchin_deterred_during_video!="urchin never tried" | data$kelp_visibly_consumed=="yes"),]

# To compare across treatments, presence/absence of Corynactis
data$corynactis_binary <- ifelse(data$treatment_number>1, "present", "absent")

# Create variables: kelp area consumed, percent kelp consumed
data <- data %>%
  mutate(area_consumed=(kelp_before_cm_2-kelp_after_cm_2)) %>%
  mutate(percent_consumed=(area_consumed/kelp_before_cm_2))

# look at "minimum % kelp consumed cutoff" contradictions between ImageJ and visual analysis
#datan <- subset(data, Visible_consumption=="no")
#datay <- subset(data, Visible_consumption=="yes")
#sort(datan$percent_consumed) #If any percent consumption is less than 0.04, we assume there was no consumption (aka 'remove' ImageJ analysis error)...minus the one piece of kelp that definitely had a tiny bit of urchin chewing it
#data$percent_corrected <- ifelse(data$`Percent of Kelp Consumed`>0.04, data$`Percent of Kelp Consumed`, 0)
data$percent_corrected <- ifelse(data$kelp_visibly_consumed=="no", 0, data$percent_consumed)
data$area_corrected <- ifelse(data$kelp_visibly_consumed=="no", 0, data$area_consumed)

# To compare consumption (yes, no) across treatments
data$consumption_binary <- ifelse(data$percent_corrected>0, 1, 0)

# Average urchin body weight before and after trials
data <- data %>%
  mutate(urchin_avg_g = rowMeans(cbind(urchin_weight_before_g,urchin_weight_after_g)))

# To see if balcony versus wet lab location had an effect
data$experiment_location <- ifelse(data$tank_number>6, "Balcony", "Lab")

# take averages (kelp consumption) of each tile, create new data frame from subsetted averages
# keep all control values rather than average them (if I pursue averaging repeated tiles), assign each control trial a unique number
#data$cory_tile_number[data$cory_tile_number==0] <- c(-1:-15)
```

### Visualize the data

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(y=area_corrected, x=treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(size=1.5,alpha=0.9, width=0.1) +
  labs(x="Treatment", y=expression("Kelp area consumed "(~cm^2))) +
  theme_bw()
```

It looks like there are a lot more zeroes in the experimental treatments versus the control treatment so...

## Is there any difference between urchins that ate or didn't eat kelp?

#### Rough visualization of distribution using chi-square test

	#### extract correction method

    lbls[i] <- paste(popsNames[prs[,i]],collapse=" vs. ")
  }
  adj.pvals <- p.adjust(pvals,method=control)
  cat("Adjusted p-values used the",control,"method.\n\n")
  data.frame(comparison=lbls,raw.p=round(pvals,digits),adj.p=round(adj.pvals,digits))
}

chisq.post.hoc(t1, control = "bonferroni", popsInRows  = TRUE)
```

Control and Red are different

## What is the effect of Corynactis color on whether or not urchins ate kelp (averaged amongst tiles)?

#### Treat the data as Bernoulli (sucesses vs. failures)

Because not every tile was actually used twice (thanks to urchins not moving, etc), get the total counts each tile was used and add it as a column to data frame
```{r, message=FALSE}
data <- data[order(data$cory_tile_number),] #sort whole data frame by tile number

df <- data # separate this organization from the whole data frame in case you mess something up

df <- df[order(df$cory_tile_number),] #sort subsetted data frame by tile number

df$cory_tile_number[df$cory_tile_number==0] <- c(-1:-15) #change all controls to unique negative numbers to get count values

new <- count(df, cory_tile_number) #count values for each tile number

duptimes <- c(new$n) #how many replicates I want of each row

indx <- rep(1:nrow(new), duptimes) # Create an index of the rows I want with duplications
dupdf <- new[indx,] # Use that index to generate new data frame
dupdf$cory_tile_number[1:15] <-0 #change control values back to tile number "0"
dupdf$n[1:15] <- 15 #change duplications for control tiles to 15
data$count_per_tile <- dupdf$n #add the counts to the whole data frame

#now put it all together 
#library(dplyr)
data_avg <- data %>%
  group_by(cory_tile_number) %>%                                     # group tile numbers together
  mutate(success=sum(consumption_binary, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%     #number of successes
  mutate(failure=ifelse(count_per_tile==2, abs(success-2), ifelse(count_per_tile==1,abs(success-1), 3))) %>%  #number of failures, given number of times tile was used
  mutate(binary_avg=mean(consumption_binary, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% #average successes/total attempts
  mutate(avg_area=mean(area_consumed, na.rm=TRUE))  %>%       # mean kelp consumption of each tile group
  mutate(avg_percent=mean(percent_consumed, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%  # mean % kelp consumption of each tile group
  ungroup() %>%                                               # ungroup data REALLY IMPT when using group_by
  distinct(cory_tile_number, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%                   # remove duplicate tiles
  dplyr::select(treatment, cory_tile_number, urchin_avg_g, success, failure, binary_avg, count_per_tile, kelp_before_cm_2, kelp_after_cm_2, area_corrected) # clean up! extract only columns you want
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
#create the model
library(lme4)

#treating the data as bernoulli, sucesses given failures amongst treatments and tiles
m1 <- glm(cbind(success, count_per_tile-success) ~ treatment, family = binomial , data = data_avg)
summary(m1)
aov(m1)
```

## Among the urchins that ate, does Corynactis matter in how much kelp was consumed?

#### Look at univariate distribution of kelp consumption 
```{r}
# create new data frame for instances where urchins ate something (not nothing)
data_consumption <- subset(data, data$area_corrected>0)

# Univariate analysis for Y
hist(data_consumption$area_corrected, main="") #looks fine
boxplot(data_consumption$area_corrected) #2 outliers
qqnorm(data_consumption$area_corrected)
qqline(data_consumption$area_corrected) #could be better, but let's look at the model/residuals
```

#### Maybe remove two outliers?

```{r, fig.show="hide"}
# Isolate outliers in data
outliers <- boxplot(data_consumption$area_corrected)$out
data_consumption <- data_consumption[-which(data_consumption$area_corrected %in% outliers),]
```

```{r}
# Univariate analysis for Y (minus outliers)
hist(data_consumption$area_corrected, main="")
boxplot(data_consumption$area_corrected)
qqnorm(data_consumption$area_corrected)
qqline(data_consumption$area_corrected)
```

Sure, looks better

#### Now visualize the relationship between treatment and kelp consumption
```{r}
ggplot(data_consumption,aes(x=corynactis_binary,y=area_corrected))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter()+
  labs(x="Treatment", y=expression("Kelp area consumed, when consumed "(~cm^2))) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data_consumption,aes(x=treatment,y=area_corrected))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter()+
  labs(x="Treatment", y=expression("Kelp area consumed, when consumed "(~cm^2))) +
  theme_bw()
```

There really is no apparent relationship between presence/absence Corynactis or Treatment and the amount of kelp consumed, but let's run stats anyway for good measure

### Mixed model ANOVA
#### Treatment is a fixed effect, tile number is a random effect
```{r, message=FALSE, results="show", warning=FALSE}
# add tile as a random effect
library(lmerTest)
m2 <- lmer(area_corrected ~ treatment + (1|cory_tile_number), data = data_consumption)
summary(m2)
anova(m2)

# let's look at the residuals
data_consumption$predicted <- predict(m2)
data_consumption$residuals <- residuals(m2)
plot(residuals~predicted, data=data_consumption) #looks fine
abline(0, 0)
```

Yep, as suspected, there was no effect of treatment on amount of kelp consumed by urchins, when any kelp was consumed

# So, in conclusion:
- #### Red color morph increases probability urchin will fail to eat any kelp
- #### But there was no effect of color morph (or even the simple presence of Corynactis) on amount of kelp consumed, when looking only at urchins that did consume kelp
