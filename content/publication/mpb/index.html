abstract: A wide range of ecological and environmental factors influence metal bioaccumulation in fish. Studies of mercury and other metal contaminants in invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish are limited, yet consumption of the invasive predator is increasingly utilized as a management strategy. In this study, we examined the effects of body size, body condition, sex, trophic level, carbon source, diet, depth and capture location on mercury concentrations in lionfish collected from Curaçao. In addition, we examined whether or not a local oil refinery is the source of metal contamination in lionfish. Mercury concentrations ranged from 0.008 to 0.106 ppm and we found no effect of the oil refinery on metal bioaccumulation in lionfish. Although low mercury levels indicate lionfish are safe for consumption, elevated levels of other metals suggest a contamination source around Curaçao.
