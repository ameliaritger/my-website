##### Lompoc Landing, one of my field sites for my research with **Tegula funebralis**

## Black turban snails

I am using the black turban snail (**Tegula funebralis**) to explore large-scale patterns of intraspecific variation. 

**Tegula funebralis** exist across the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, which extends from Baja California (Mexico) to British Columbia (Canada). Across this broad geographic range, Tegula funebralis populations are exposed to a mosaic of intertidal pH conditions (thanks to variable upwelling regimes) as well as different predator communities. 

My research explores how **Tegula funebralis** populations may be responding differently to variable pH conditions and predator communities across their range - which has important implications for calcifying intertidal organisms in the context of ocean acidification and future climate change scenarios.
