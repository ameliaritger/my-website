## Strawberry anemones

This page is under construction. Please check back later! 

In the meantime, check out my Github repositories for my research-in-progress on Corynactis californica <a href="https://github.com/ameliaritger/Ritger-2019-Corynactis-measurements" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ameliaritger/Ritger-2019-Corynactis-urchin-deterrence" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Black turban snails

I am using the black turban snail (*Tegula funebralis*) to explore large-scale patterns of intraspecific variation.

*Tegula funebralis* exist across the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, which extends from Baja California (Mexico) to British Columbia (Canada). Across this broad geographic range, *Tegula funebralis* populations are exposed to a mosaic of intertidal pH conditions (thanks to variable upwelling regimes) as well as different predator communities.

Climate change is predicted to intensify upwelling and shift ecological communities, but there is limited research on how marine populations across the CCLME may differ in their response to OA and altered community structure. 

My research explores how *Tegula funebralis* populations may be responding differently to variable pH conditions and predator communities across their range. This research will reveal how a species may vary in its vulnerability and resiliency to environmental change across its range, and may inform ecosystem management and conservation strategies in the context of future climate change scenarios.
