## Strawberry anemones

I am using the strawberry anemone (*Corynactis californica*) to study the ecological consequences of intraspecific variation at the population level.

Traditionally, ecologists have viewed between-species (interspecific) diversity as a crucial element of the natural world. However, we are increasingly recognizing the influence of within-species (intraspecific) diversity to ecosystem structure and community dynamics.

The strawberry anemone (*Corynactis californica*) is a phenotypically diverse, clonal organism found on temperate rocky reefs in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. The strawberry anemone is a fierce competitor that aggressively defends its territory by growing colonies through asexual reproduction and using its nematocysts (stinging cells) against other benthic species. As a result, strawberry anemones have the capacity to provide an associational refuge to macroalgae and invertebrates from benthic predators that avoid contact with the nematocysts. 

Variation between strawberry anemone colonies likely has important implications for their ecological role on temperate rocky reefs. For example, sea urchins forage less when in the presence of particular strawberry anemone color morphs (see experimental results <a href="https://github.com/ameliaritger/Ritger-2019-Corynactis-urchin-deterrence" target="_blank">here</a>), and individual strawberry anemone colonies vary in the rate at which they kill corals and anemones using their nematocysts.

My research on *Corynactis californica* explores the various ways this understudied corallimorph may further our understanding of how intraspecific variation may affect ecological dynamics in kelp forest communities.

## Black turban snails

I am using the black turban snail (*Tegula funebralis*) to explore large-scale patterns of intraspecific variation. 

![A sunny California intertidal zone](/img/lol2.jpg)

*Tegula funebralis* exist across the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, which extends from Baja California (Mexico) to British Columbia (Canada). Across this broad geographic range, *Tegula funebralis* populations are exposed to a mosaic of intertidal pH conditions (thanks to variable upwelling regimes) as well as different predator communities.

Climate change is predicted to intensify upwelling and shift ecological communities, but there is limited research on how marine populations across the CCLME may differ in their response to OA and altered community structure. 

My research explores how *Tegula funebralis* populations may be responding differently to variable pH conditions and predator communities across their range. This research will reveal how a species may vary in its vulnerability and resiliency to environmental change across its range, and may inform ecosystem management and conservation strategies in the context of future climate change scenarios.
