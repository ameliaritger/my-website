One project sought to better understand the mechanistic basis of reproductive division of labor, the phenomenon attributed to eusocial insects (like bees, wasps, and ants) in which a single individual (the queen) lays eggs and all other individuals (the workers) carry out the other tasks necessary for the colony to function. For this project, I worked with graduate student Vikram Chandra and explored the role of ILP2 (insulin-like peptide 2) to the reproductive and brood-care phases of the clonal raider ant. We injected ants with ILP2 during their brood-care phase (when they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be reproducing) and measured significant oocyte activity (egg production). Coupled with transcriptomics and brain antibody staining, our study provides strong evidence for the role of ILP2, nutrition, and larval signals in the evolution of eusociality.

Many scientists attribute this to the lionfish being a generalist predator - for example, when scientists dissect the stomachs of invasive lionfish across the Caribbean, they find a diversity of species (although some species are more common than others). I wanted to know if, when given a choice between prey items, lionfish are selective foragers. My field assistant extraordinaire, Tyler Fountain, and I stocked a large underwater enclosure containing an artificial reef with 3 prey species frequently consumed by invasive lionfish and observed what lionfish ate when released into the enclosures. Surprisingly, we found that lionfish consistently exhibited a preference for one prey species in particular - brown chromis. Knowing that lionfish exhibit active prey discrimination will help researchers better understand and predict the effects of lionfish on coral reef fish communities. You can learn more in the publication here, the repository here, and in a blog I maintained while working in Curaçao here.\nPollutant bioaccumulation One way that humans are fighting to control invasive lionfish on coral reefs is by eating them. Because lionfish are a mesopredator (one step below apex predators), they have the capacity to bioaccumulate high, and possibly dangerous, levels of pollutants such as mercury and other heavy metals. On the island of Curaçao, there is an oil refinery that releases contaminants into the air and marine environment. I collected hundreds of lionfish around Curaçao and analyzed their tissue for metal contaminants. Unsurprisingly, mercury concentrations were higher in larger fish, but mercury concentrations overall were well below the human health criterion established by the Environmental Protection Agency. Lionfish also contained low levels of other metals such as arsenic and selenium. These findings support continued - and enthusiastic - consumption of invasive lionfish as a sustainable and environmentally-beneficial source of protein and income for local communities and tourists. You can read more about this research here and here.\nSea tomatoes As an undergraduate at Dartmouth, I worked with Jessica Trout-Haney in the Cottingham Lab on Nostoc pruniforme (known colloquially as the sea tomato), a benthic cyanobacteria found in ponds and lakes in Greenland. Nostoc can be incredibly dense in some lakes (over 9000/square meter) and likely contribute microcystins (a cyanotoxin) into aquatic ecosystems. Our study coupled observations and experiments to examine how Nostoc produce and release microcystins, and my focus was on how microcystin production varies throughout the colony. We found microcystins throughout the colony and observed undamaged colonies leaking microcystins into the surrounding water. Coupled with field observations of elevated microcystin concentrations around Nostoc colonies in Greenlandic lakes, these results provide strong evidence for Nostoc pruniforme as microcystin producers in Arctic freshwater ecosystems.

In Arctic lakes, benthic producers often comprise mats or colonies of cyanobacteria capable of producing cyanotoxins. However, the extent to which benthic communities contribute cyanotoxins in polar regions remains poorly described. We evaluated the potential for benthic colonies of the cyanobacterium Nostoc pruniforme from lakes in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, to contribute microcystins (MCs) to lake water using three approaches. First, we dissected field-collected Nostoc colonies and measured MCs within multiple layers of fresh colony tissue. Second, we conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate the temporal dynamics of MC release by incubated, intact colonies. Finally, we quantified whether MC concentrations in water and sediment samples in the field were higher in and above dense bands of benthic Nostoc as compared to bare sediment. Field-collected Nostoc colonies contained MCs throughout the colony tissue, suggesting that damage to colonies from grazers or physical disturbance could facilitate the release of toxins into the water. Undamaged Nostoc colonies incubated in high-nutrient conditions in the laboratory leaked MCs as a curvilinear function into the surrounding water over the course of seven days, at rates that varied with colony density. MC concentrations in water and sediment from two Greenlandic lakes were highly variable, but slightly higher in lake water immediately above dense bands of Nostoc than in water immediately above bare sediments, suggesting that benthic Nostoc colonies contribute cyanotoxins to lake water and that MCs vary at very fine, 1-2 m spatial scales. Benthic cyanobacteria may be important in releasing MCs into aquatic ecosystems, especially in systems where benthic producers dominate, such as polar environments.","tags":["cyanobacteria","toxins","Arctic","baccalaureate","ecosystem"],"title":"Benthic cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc are a source of microcystins in Greenlandic lakes and ponds","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587081600,"objectID":"65804cd0af337ca6e19983ad2c74fc31","permalink":"/projects/shiny-mbon/","publishdate":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/shiny-mbon/","section":"projects","summary":"MBON","tags":null,"title":"Shiny","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Amelia L.

However, these methods are limited in their capacity to make inferences about foraging decisions by predators in variable environments or recreate the array of factors (such as prey traits, predator condition, and environmental conditions) present in natural systems which may interact to affect diet decisions by predators. Recent work has provided evidence for selectivity in the invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish (*Pterois volitans/miles*) despite the predator’s apparent opportunistic, generalist feeding behavior. We directly tested diet choice by presenting wild-caught lionfish with multi-species prey assemblages in field enclosures. We offered lionfish equal biomasses of prey species sharing similar prey traits that are both highly abundant on coral reefs and prevalent in the lionfish diet across the invaded range. We then applied compositional analyses to determine relative prey consumption given prey availability. We observed lionfish selectively foraging on prey and manifesting strong consistent preferences for one prey species. Additionally, we observed condition-dependent foraging behavior, as lionfish with higher body conditions were more likely to exhibit selective foraging behavior. Our findings provide direct evidence for diet choice in an invasive generalist species and highlight the importance of preserving the ecological complexity of natural ecosystems in choice experiments, particularly when investigating predator-prey interactions in complex environments.","tags":["lionfish","predator-prey","animal behavior","Curaçao","post baccalaureate"],"title":"Diet choice in a generalist predator, the invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"4461de8440f66420a829ef3139b2dc8c","permalink":"/research-home/tegula/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research-home/tegula/","section":"research-home","summary":"\r\r","tags":["present research"],"title":"Tegula funebralis","type":"research-home"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\r[[item]]\rorganization = “Ocean Global Change Biology REU”\rorganization_url = “https://oceanchangereuucsb.com/”\rtitle = “Mentor”\rurl = \"\"\rcertificate_url = \"\"\rdate_start = “2019-06-24”\rdate_end = \"\"\rdescription = “Xavius Boone, UC Davis”\nHere’s some sweet code!\nAn amazing plot!\nplot(cars)\r","date":1561334400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578610948,"objectID":"a3f5ddb446993385202bf356092bb8b8","permalink":"/teaching/my-new-project/","publishdate":"2019-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/my-new-project/","section":"teaching","summary":"\r[[item]]\rorganization = “Ocean Global Change Biology REU”\rorganization_url = “https://oceanchangereuucsb.com/”\rtitle = “Mentor”\rurl = \"\"\rcertificate_url = \"\"\rdate_start = “2019-06-24”\rdate_end = \"\"\rdescription = “Xavius Boone, UC Davis”\nHere’s some sweet code!\nAn amazing plot!\nplot(cars)\r","tags":["dogs","hiking"],"title":"I will do this later!","type":"teaching"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view \r  Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of reproductive division of labor remain obscure. Using a brain transcriptomics screen, we identified a single gene, insulin-like peptide 2 (ilp2), which is always up-regulated in ant reproductives, likely because they are better nourished than their nonreproductive nestmates. In clonal raider ants (*Ooceraea biroi*), larval signals inhibit adult reproduction by suppressing ilp2, thus producing a colony reproductive cycle reminiscent of ancestral subsociality. However, increasing ILP2 peptide levels overrides larval suppression, thereby breaking the colony cycle and inducing a stable division of labor. These findings suggest a simple model for the origin of ant eusociality via nutritionally determined reproductive asymmetries potentially amplified by larval signals.","tags":["ants","animal behavior","evolution","post baccalaureate"],"title":"Social regulation of insulin signaling and the evolution of eusociality in ants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amelia L.
