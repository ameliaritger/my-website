Nostoc can be incredibly dense in some lakes (over 9000/square meter) and likely contribute microcystins (a cyanotoxin) into aquatic ecosystems. Our study coupled observations and experiments to examine how Nostoc produce and release microcystins, and my focus was on how microcystin production varies throughout the colony. We found microcystins throughout the colony and observed undamaged colonies leaking microcystins into the surrounding water. Coupled with field observations of elevated microcystin concentrations around Nostoc colonies in Greenlandic lakes, these results provide strong evidence for Nostoc pruniforme as microcystin producers in Arctic freshwater ecosystems.

One project sought to better understand the mechanistic basis of reproductive division of labor, the phenomenon attributed to eusocial insects (like bees, wasps, and ants) in which a single individual (the queen) lays eggs and all other individuals (the workers) carry out the other tasks necessary for the colony to function. For this project, I worked with graduate student Vikram Chandra and explored the role of ILP2 (insulin-like peptide 2) to the reproductive and brood-care phases of the clonal raider ant. We injected ants with ILP2 during their brood-care phase (when they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be reproducing) and measured significant oocyte activity (egg production). Coupled with transcriptomics and brain antibody staining, our study provides strong evidence for the role of ILP2, nutrition, and larval signals in the evolution of eusociality.

Many scientists attribute this to the lionfish being a generalist predator - for example, when scientists dissect the stomachs of invasive lionfish across the Caribbean, they find a diversity of species (although some species are more common than others). I wanted to know if, when given a choice between prey items, lionfish are selective foragers. My field assistant extraordinaire, Tyler Fountain, and I stocked a large underwater enclosure containing an artificial reef with 3 prey species frequently consumed by invasive lionfish and observed what lionfish ate when released into the enclosures. Surprisingly, we found that lionfish consistently exhibited a preference for one prey species in particular - brown chromis. Knowing that lionfish exhibit active prey discrimination will help researchers better understand and predict the effects of lionfish on coral reef fish communities. You can learn more in the publication here, the repository here, and in a blog I maintained while working in Curaçao here.\nPollutant bioaccumulation One way that humans are fighting to control invasive lionfish on coral reefs is by eating them. Because lionfish are a mesopredator (one step below apex predators), they have the capacity to bioaccumulate high, and possibly dangerous, levels of pollutants such as mercury and other heavy metals. On the island of Curaçao, there is an oil refinery that releases contaminants into the air and marine environment. I collected hundreds of lionfish around Curaçao and analyzed their tissue for metal contaminants. Unsurprisingly, mercury concentrations were higher in larger fish, but mercury concentrations overall were well below the human health criterion established by the Environmental Protection Agency. Lionfish also contained low levels of other metals such as arsenic and selenium. These findings support continued - and enthusiastic - consumption of invasive lionfish as a sustainable and environmentally-beneficial source of protein and income for local communities and tourists.

In Arctic lakes, benthic producers often comprise mats or colonies of cyanobacteria capable of producing cyanotoxins. However, the extent to which benthic communities contribute cyanotoxins in polar regions remains poorly described. We evaluated the potential for benthic colonies of the cyanobacterium Nostoc pruniforme from lakes in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, to contribute microcystins (MCs) to lake water using three approaches. First, we dissected field-collected Nostoc colonies and measured MCs within multiple layers of fresh colony tissue. Second, we conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate the temporal dynamics of MC release by incubated, intact colonies. Finally, we quantified whether MC concentrations in water and sediment samples in the field were higher in and above dense bands of benthic Nostoc as compared to bare sediment. Field-collected Nostoc colonies contained MCs throughout the colony tissue, suggesting that damage to colonies from grazers or physical disturbance could facilitate the release of toxins into the water. Undamaged Nostoc colonies incubated in high-nutrient conditions in the laboratory leaked MCs as a curvilinear function into the surrounding water over the course of seven days, at rates that varied with colony density. MC concentrations in water and sediment from two Greenlandic lakes were highly variable, but slightly higher in lake water immediately above dense bands of Nostoc than in water immediately above bare sediments, suggesting that benthic Nostoc colonies contribute cyanotoxins to lake water and that MCs vary at very fine, 1-2 m spatial scales. Benthic cyanobacteria may be important in releasing MCs into aquatic ecosystems, especially in systems where benthic producers dominate, such as polar environments.","tags":["cyanobacteria","toxins","Arctic","baccalaureate","ecosystem"],"title":"Benthic cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc are a source of microcystins in Greenlandic lakes and ponds","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r","date":1587081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587081600,"objectID":"067bf5685fd0f39809933bddebae0faa","permalink":"/research-home/corynactis/","publishdate":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research-home/corynactis/","section":"research-home","summary":"Subtext..?","tags":["present research"],"title":"Corynactis californica","type":"research-home"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r","date":1587081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587081600,"objectID":"11d73d6d9e58b333f926e5abf602b62a","permalink":"/research-home/nostoc/","publishdate":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research-home/nostoc/","section":"research-home","summary":"Subtext...","tags":["past research"],"title":"Nostoc pruniforme","type":"research-home"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r","date":1587081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587081600,"objectID":"5043e513b18226e98606b1f968c7f992","permalink":"/research-home/ooceraea/","publishdate":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research-home/ooceraea/","section":"research-home","summary":"Subtext?","tags":["past research"],"title":"Ooceraea biroi","type":"research-home"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r","date":1587081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587081600,"objectID":"b7bd34bf65be5b3e90b02958f802aff2","permalink":"/research-home/lionfish/","publishdate":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research-home/lionfish/","section":"research-home","summary":"Subtext?","tags":["past research"],"title":"Pterois volitans","type":"research-home"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587081600,"objectID":"65804cd0af337ca6e19983ad2c74fc31","permalink":"/projects/shiny-mbon/","publishdate":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/shiny-mbon/","section":"projects","summary":"MBON","tags":null,"title":"Shiny","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587081600,"objectID":"6af4d70df22a2538f4a49cb428cfe1ef","permalink":"/projects/test-course/","publishdate":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/test-course/","section":"projects","summary":"curse","tags":null,"title":"test!","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Amelia L.

choice in marine species is typically derived from indirect methods such as stomach contents and stable isotope analysis, while choice experiments in controlled laboratory settings are used to infer foraging decisions in the wild. However, these methods are limited in their capacity to make inferences about foraging decisions by predators in variable environments or recreate the array of factors (such as prey traits, predator condition, and environmental conditions) present in natural systems which may interact to affect diet decisions by predators.","tags":["lionfish","diet"],"title":"Lionfish diet choice experiment","type":"projects"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\rThis project explored how intraspecific variation might play a role in the ability of the strawberry anemone (Corynactis californica) to act as a deterrent to urchin foraging.\nPurple urchins, starved for a minimum of 7 days, were placed in aquaria containing kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) protected by a barrier of strawberry anemones. 3 color morphs of strawberry anemones were used (Red, Pink, and Orange) in trials to assess any differences in the ability of genets (genetically identical individuals) to deter urchins from grazing on kelp. Kelp consumption by urchins was measured using photos taken of kelp blades before and after experimental trials, which lasted between 19:00 and 7:00 (30 minutes before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively) in late August-early September. Urchin behavior was tracked using photos (taken by GoPro Hero3+) of the experimental set up each minute for approximately 5 hours at the start of each experiment. Urchin behavior was compared between genets to examine how intraspecific variation might play a role in the associational refuge offered by the strawberry anemone to macroalgae in temperate kelp forests.\nThe following code works through data organization and analysis of urchin foraging behavior ( minus video analysis), analysis using logistic regression treating binary kelp consumption (yes/no) as a Bernoulli distribution and mixed model ANOVA treating tile as a random effect in kelp consumption by urchins\nLoad packages, load data, tidy data\r#LOAD PACKAGES\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(zoo)\rlibrary(GGally)\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rlibrary(janitor)\rlibrary(here)\r## LOAD DATA\rdata \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;raw.csv\u0026quot;)\r## TIDY DATA\r# my own OCD, fix \u0026quot;Trial\u0026quot;

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of reproductive division of labor remain obscure. Using a brain transcriptomics screen, we identified a single gene, insulin-like peptide 2 (ilp2), which is always up-regulated in ant reproductives, likely because they are better nourished than their nonreproductive nestmates. In clonal raider ants (*Ooceraea biroi*), larval signals inhibit adult reproduction by suppressing ilp2, thus producing a colony reproductive cycle reminiscent of ancestral subsociality. However, increasing ILP2 peptide levels overrides larval suppression, thereby breaking the colony cycle and inducing a stable division of labor. These findings suggest a simple model for the origin of ant eusociality via nutritionally determined reproductive asymmetries potentially amplified by larval signals.","tags":["ants","animal behavior","evolution","post baccalaureate"],"title":"Social regulation of insulin signaling and the evolution of eusociality in ants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amelia L.

Studies of mercury and other metal contaminants in invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish are limited, yet consumption of the invasive predator is increasingly utilized as a management strategy. In this study, we examined the effects of body size, body condition, sex, trophic level, carbon source, diet, depth and capture location on mercury concentrations in lionfish collected from Curaçao. In addition, we examined whether or not a local oil refinery is the source of metal contamination in lionfish. Mercury concentrations ranged from 0.008 to 0.106 ppm and we found no effect of the oil refinery on metal bioaccumulation in lionfish. Although low mercury levels indicate lionfish are safe for consumption, elevated levels of other metals suggest a contamination source around Curaçao.","tags":["lionfish","pollution","Curaçao","post baccalaureate"],"title":"Bioaccumulation of mercury and other metal contaminants in invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) from Curaçao","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amelia L.
